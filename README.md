# car-filter-javascript

This project is a simple web app that allows users to filter a list of cars based on different criteria, such as make, model, and year. The app is built using JavaScript and makes use of some of the language's core features and concepts, such as arrays, objects, and event listeners.

To use the app, simply select the criteria you want to filter by from the dropdown menus. The list of cars will be updated to show only those that match your selected criteria.

This project is a great way to practice my JavaScript skills and learn more about working with arrays, objects, and events. Give it a try and see how well you can filter the list of cars!
